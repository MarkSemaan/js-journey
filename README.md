<h1>Practicing in JavaScript</h1>

<h2>Calculating Average Grades for Students and Displaying them</h2>
<p>This simple script contains a series of if statements to determine their average grade, and uses 2 different array methods, map and forEach.</p>
<p>The time complexity of it should be O(n*k) where n is the number of students and k is the limit of ammount of scores for each student, first to iterate through each student and then iterate through their scores.</p>

<h2>Bank Account Class</h2>
<p>This is an implementation of classes in JavaScript with methods and objects.</p>
<p>Most individual methods have complexities: O(1) except for printHistory which is O(h) here h is the number of transactions in the history.</p>
<p>Overall should be in O(1) time because it performs a fixed, small number of operations.</p>

<h2>To-Do List with HTML, CSS and JS</h2>
<p>Combining HTML, CSS and JavaScript to breathe life into webpages and make them functional. To-Do list is just a very simple implementation of it.</p>
